4.  A browser will open and you should see the directory. Click on the either scatter plot or bar chart example
5.  A new tab will open to this notebook.
6.  You won't see the D3 graph the first time until you click Cell > Run All as you need to run the entire notebook. After running all the cells once, the next time you return the notebook, you will see the graph again.
